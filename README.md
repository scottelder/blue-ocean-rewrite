# blue-ocean-rewrite

## Contribution Guidelines
We expect our new software engineers to start contributing to our codebase immediately. That doesn't mean we want maverick manatees swimming wild and munching on whatever looks tastiest with no concern for what other herdmates are doing. That means:
  1. No code shall be written except that which addresses a specific ticket.
  2. Blue Ocean is an agile workspace open to exploring any techniques which improve deliverable cycle speed. **We strongly encourage pair programming tickets with high point values** and freeform collaboration between different teams on an as-needed basis.
  3. 

## Git Workflow
We take version control very seriously here at Blue Ocean. You will be expected to:
  1. Work on separate branches.
  2. Commit often.
  3. Write clear, concise, imperative-mood commit messages.
  4. Use `git rebase` to 
  4. Submit pull requests when looking to merge with the master branch.
  5. **Always pull from master onto your working branch and fix conflicts before submitting a pull request to master.** 
  6. Approve pull requests only if you did not write any of the code submitted for review.
